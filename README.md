# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is an app developed to display some of my web development work to potential employers and to give them a way to contact me. It was good practice for using the Bootstrap framework.

The app is divided into three pages: an About Page, a Contact Page, and a Portfolio Page. The About Page contains my picture and a bit of information on my strengths as an employee.The contact page uses formspree to allow employers to send me a message. The Portfolio Page displays six select projects. The user can click on one of the six screenshots and they will be presented with basic information about the project and a link to the app and the code. 

The deployed version of the app is found at: https://jacobugath.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/
