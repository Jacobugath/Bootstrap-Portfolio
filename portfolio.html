                                <h2>Hangman Game</h2>
                                This is one of the first assignments I did through the U of U Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The point of the assignment was to practice dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                 The app uses key events to listen for letters that a user will type. The dynamically updated HTML will inform the user whether or not their key stroke is part of the word they are trying to guess. The app also keeps track of the number of wins and losses.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                              Intrestingly enough, it turns out that comic book action words use rare combinations of letters, so they are pretty darn hard to guess. Give it a shot!

                                    <br>
                                     The app pulls trivia questions from an API and presents a form with multiple choice options. The user has a limited amount of time to finish each question, after which the question is marked incorrect.

                                    If the player chooses the incorrect answer, they are told they are are wrong and given the correct answer.

                                         The game features office workers hurling fireballs at each other. The funest part was getting fireballs to fly across the screen and making them increase in size as they do more damage.
                                        <br>

                                        The object of the game is to defeat all other office workers without your health droping to zero. The player's damage doubles with each attack, while the defenders damage remains static.

                                                This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. I chose a theme using Gifs from my favorite TV show 'The Office' To finish this task, I had to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML the site.

                                                    This is the final project I did through the U of U Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The point of the assignment was to practice working with a group, and writing an entire app from end to end. This app was written using the MERN stack.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>
                                                    The app allows users to search for tattoos and tattoo artists based on certain criteria and tags (style and placement on the body) and returns images and details of the tattoo that meet the user’s criteria.
